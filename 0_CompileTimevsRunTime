Compile time vs run time

First for language like c++ 

We take the source code and get into machine code, so a compiler converts source code to machine code and generates an executable

This is compile time
Compile time errors like syntax errors etc
Adding number to string etc
__________________________________

Run time -


Main function is executed here
When the coupled code is run
The compiled code or executable is loaded in the ram and then run on cpu
Run time error-
Erro can be logic error etc
Exception handling - divide by 0 etc


compiled language - c , c++, objective c
interpreted language - javacsriopt, php


hybrid labguage - c#, java
