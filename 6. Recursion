Recursion-
___________________________


When a function calls itself

It is used when a solution to a problem depends on solution to smaller instances of the same problem.

When using recursion , always have a base case to break from the recursion


Can solve a problem, but might not be the best way to solve a problem, time complexity can we really worse.
