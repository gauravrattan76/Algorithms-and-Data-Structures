Graphs Data Structure-
________________________________

Node/ Vertex -

Is the node for that graph.
We also call it edge 
UniDirectional Graph-


V1   ……> v2

Bidirectional graphs
To and from between x and y
_____________________________________

Weight graphs-

A >>>>>.b.  there is a weight of 10

Weighted graph will have some weights
___________________________________

Un weighted graph doesn’t have any weights


We will have undirected and lighted graph


We can also have directed and unweighted graph

__________________________________

Adjacency list graphs-


List of lists

Array of array list


Array size is equal to number of vertex


And on each index item we will create list on each item index

So graph is an array of array list


We can say 


Arraylist<Edge> graph[vertx]


So each element in array consists of array list


Array list.add(new Edge(sec, des))


Class Edge{
Int src;
Int des;
}
